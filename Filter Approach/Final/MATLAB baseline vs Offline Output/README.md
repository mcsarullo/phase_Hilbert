Both folders contain results of the Teensy 4.0 vs. MATLAB baseline.

If <100 MB, I also uploaded the .fig files for convenience. If not, they did not upload and only a .png shows.

HistogramDelays.png - Depicts a histogram of the delays (in samples) of each peak in phase.

AbsoluteError.png - Depicts the continuous absolute error alongside phase and bandpassed data.

DelayOverTime.png - Continuous graph of the the delay (in samples), at each delay. A delay was detected when a significant change in phase (after a drop from a peak) was detected, then the difference in samples of each peak was calculated and plotted.
