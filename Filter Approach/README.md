comboSine.m - MATLAB for creating artificial sine waves for experimentation without signal generator. 

BP_Filter.ino - C for Bandpass filter with some hard-coded waves already included.

FilterDesignManual.ino - original C file for Hilbert filter with hard-coded coefficient values. Replicates MATLAB output (and documentation) nearly perfectly.
